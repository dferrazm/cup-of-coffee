Some CoffeeScript snippets and stuff...

## Bootstrap Modals Wrapper

Wrapper on top of the bootstrap modal plugin.
Use the `ModalComponent` when wanting to create a simple modal.
Use the `ModalRemoteComponent` when the modal's content is a remote resource.
Use the `ModalFormComponent` when the modal's content is a remote form.

## TODO

- Some JS tests.
